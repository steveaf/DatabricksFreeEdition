#  CodeSpaces

Codespaces gives a VSCode environment in the cloud.   
<

My hopes
* Avoid installing locally so the codespaces environment can match the work.
* Run IAC 
* Use anywhere 
    * work
    * home
    * iPad? 
* Compare to bare metal
* Compare to Podman with VSCode
* See if I like the editor experience. 

## Steps

Log into your GitHub account. 
Find a branch to use.
Click <Code> button then, the "Codespaces"

**Create Codespace**
In your repo when you select codespace, use the "Configure and create codespace" button.
The default creates a codespace.  

You have options that are limited in the free codespace.
