# Databricks Free

This is my databricks free edition environment.  I want to create demos and document the experience. 

# Local Setup
Several steps are needed on your local PC before you can accomplish anything.  This seems like an anti pattern, so I'll see if I still think so.

Sign up for Databricks free edition.  I associated my gmail to databricks years ago.  Most logins take multiple attempts where I paste the 6 letter 2FA.  I asked but am not on support, so each time I log in on my personal account getting back can take 10 minutes plus or minus.

Use your GitHub repo.  Those are free and have several well documented steps to follow.

Install some GitHub plugin specific to Databricks.  Antipattern? 

DABS CLI on your local machine.  The wall gets higher?  Maintaining these over time more complicated?  

Get your Databricks Personal Access Token.
